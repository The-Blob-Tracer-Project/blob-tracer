# Blob Tracer

The project focuses on implementing object tracking algorithms. Features that change their shape and size as they move in space (for example, cloud in blue sky, or plasma 'blobs' in 'edge' of fusion devices) are difficult to 'track' efficiently. In this project we focus on developing numerical tools for tracking any arbitrary shape-changing features/structures as they wander in sky or inside a laboratory device.
